# Part B: Application Layer (8 marks).

## 1. Browsers:

Suppose that within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page
    containing a small amount of HTML text, 
    and that this text references `N (< 5)` very small objects on the 
    same server that must also be retrieved to present the page. 

Denote the round-trip time between your computer and the server by `R`.
Assuming that a DNS lookup is not necessary 
    (the required IP address was obtained earlier and cached),
    and that transmission, queueing, and processing times 
    are negligible compared to R, 
    as functions of R and N how much time elapses with:

### Non-persistent HTTP with no parallel TCP connections?

This would require multiple connections and sequential requests.

So, for each N request, it needs:
$R$ to get connection setup,
$R$ to send the request and get the response.

$ f(N, R) = 2 \times N \times R $

### Non-persistent HTTP with parallel connections?

This would require multiple parallel connections (1 time unit).

Ignoring the other overheads, assuming we do the n connections and n req/res
parallelly.

We need first do connections first, then do the req/res.

$ f(N, R) = 2 \times R $

### Persistent HTTP with no parallel connections, and without pipelining?

This would require 1 connection with N req/res.

$ f(N, R) = R + N \times R $

### Persistent HTTP with no parallel connections, but with pipelining? 

Since it's pipelined, all connections and req/res will be in 1 go.

so

$ f(N, R) = R $
